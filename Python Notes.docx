# Digit 0 to 9
# Special Symbols -+*/ etc
# (a**b) means b is teh power of a.

Variable  :- A Variable is a name  given to a memory  location in a program.
 Example :- name = "Abhishek"

Rules For Identifies
1. Identifies can be a combination of  uppercase and lowercase  letter , digits or an (_) underscore
    so myVariable, Variable_1, etc all are valid  Python Identifies.

2. An Identifies can not start with digits 
    so Variable1 is valid but 1variable is not valid.

3. We can not use special symbols like ! # @ % &.

4. Identifies can be of any length.

Data Types

1. Integer

2. String   (can be writen in 3 types ("Abhishek"),('Abhishek'),(''' Abhishek'''))

3. Float

4. Boolean   (True And False )

5. None    (It represent a Variable who did't have any value stored )

Keywords :-  Words which are reserved in Python.

{
    and    else     in        return
    as     except   is         True
  assert   Finally  lambda      try
  break    False    nonlocal    with
  class    for      None        while
continue   from      not         yeild
def        global    or         del
if         pass     elif        import
raise 
}

Types of Tokens

Punctuators :- These are the symbols to organize sentence structure in programming.
Example :- (),{},@,[],#,-=,+=,/=,*=,//=,= etc.


Operator precedence 

1. Parentheses{}
    {}

2. Exponentiation 
    **       

3. Bitwise nor
    ~x

4. Positive , negative (unary +,-)
    +x,-x

5. Multiplication, Division, Floor Division ,Remainder
    *,/,//,%

6. Addition, Subtraction 
    +,-

7. Bitwise and
    &

8.  Bitwise XOR
    ^

9.  Bitwise OR
    |

10. Comparisons(Relational Operators), identity Operators
    <,<=,>,>=,<>,!=,==,is,isnot

11. Logical Operators

     Boolean not  (convert True into False or False into True)
     Boolean and  (And says one value should be false will be False)
     Boolean Or   (Or says one value should be True answer will be True)


Rules of AND and Or

AND                               OR
T T =T                         T T = T
F T =F                         T F = T 
T F = F                        F T = T
F F = F                        F F = F
Expression Execution 

Example:-

A,B= 2,3
Txt ="@"
print(2*Txt*3)  # Here when ever number is getting multiple with string it will repeat n number of time (n depends upto the number by which string is multipling).


A,B="2",3
Txt ="@"
print((A+Txt)*B)   #  Here two Strings are adding with the help of + sign and repeat but multipling with B.

A,B=2,3
C=4
print(A+B*C)  #  Here first multiple done first then addition will take place.



A,B= 10,5.0
C =A*B
print(C)  # A Expression with Integer and Float it will all always return Float.


A,B=1,2
C=A/B
print(C)   # Division of two Integer always return a flaot value.


A,B = 1.5,3
C= A //B  # (To get round of value after the division) && (Here first the value of division comes into Integer and then convert intp flaot).
print(C,A/B) #  (Here in second Expression answer directly convert into float value).

floor :- It will give the closest Integer, which  is lesser  than or equal to floor value.
    Result of (A//B) is same as  floor(A/B).

A,B=12,5
C = A//B
print(C) 

Output 
2

A,B=-12,5
C=A//B
print(C)

Output
-3

A,B=12,-5
C=A//B
print(C)

Output
-3


Remainder is negative when denominator is negative

A,B=5,-2
C=A%B
print(C)

Output
-1


Comments in Python :- Means lines which compiler is going to ignore .

 # single Line Comments.

 """  This is a multi -line  Comment """



input() statement is use to get input from user.

Example :-

string input
name=input("name : ")

int input
age = int(input("age : "))

float input
price = float(input("price :"))


Conditional statement :- Statements which have Condition are called Conditional statement.
we can write Condition statement in 3 forms :-

1. if elif else
2. if 
3. if elif

 Python support  indentation .
 syntax :-
 if(Condition):
    Statement 1
elif(Condition):
    Statement 2
else:
    Statement 3

Example 1 :-

age = int(input("Enter your Age "))
if(age>=18):
    print("You are Eligible")
else:
    print("You are not Eligible")

Example 2 :-

light =input("Enter the color of light ")
if(light == "red"):
    print("Stop")
elif(light =="Yellow"):
    print("Look")
elif(light == "Green"):
    print("Go")
else:
    print("Incorrect Light Color")

Ternary Operator 

Syntax 1 :-

<var>= <var1>if<condition>else<var2>

Example :-

    Food = input("Enter any food name ")
    eat = "Yes"if Food== "cake" else "No"


Syntax 2 :-

<Statement1>if<condition>else<Statement>

Example :-

Food = input("Enter Any Food name ")
print("Yes")if Food == "cake" or Food == "Paties" else print("No")
